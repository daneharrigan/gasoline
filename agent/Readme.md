# gasoline/agent

The `agent` package accepts a `navigator.userAgent` string generated by a
browser and determines the browser and version.

At this time only Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and MSIE are supported. More browsers
should be supported as well as determining the user's platform.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "gasoline/agent"
)

func main() {
	s := "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.2 Safari/537.36"
  a := agent.Parse(s)

  fmt.Printf("Name: %s\n", a.Name)
  fmt.Printf("Version: %s\n", a.Version)
}
```
